# Technical Project Proposal Template

This repository contains the required materials for submitting a project proposal
for upper-level Computer Technology courses and Capstone projects.

## Purpose
This proposal is used to:
- Evaluate project fit and scope
- Assess technical readiness
- Approve or redirect project direction before implementation begins

## Instructions
1. **Fork this repository** - please name it what you intend on naming your final project as **this will be your project repository**.  You can make this private if you'd like, but you'll need to invite at least myself to it.
3. Complete the `proposal.md` file.
4. Commit all changes with clear commit messages
5. Submit the repository URL via Brightspace if part of an assignment, or send it to me via email or discord message if you are undertaking this for extra credit.
6. **Do not get started on this project until your proposal has been approved!**

> Proposals are evaluated on clarity, feasibility, technical understanding, and planning.  While ambition is certainly a factor you need to demonstrate you have the understanding and capacity to complete the project!

## Notes
- This proposal is considered a *living document* until approval
- Once approved, scope changes require instructor review as while this readme SHOULD be updated your proposal will live with your final repository in perpetuity!
